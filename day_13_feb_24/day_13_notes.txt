Module
======
-A module is a file that contains re-usable code & can export variables, functions , classes so that other files can import and use them.
-Code Organization , Reusability, avoid global scope
-Module Systems : CommonJS(CJS) , ECMAScript(ESM)

CommonJS
--------
-This module system is commonly used in NodeJS
To export : module.exports
To Import : require()

ESM
---
-This Module system is used by angular, react
To export : export
To Import : import

2 types of export/import:
    a. default export
    b. named export 

Ex:
import MyReact, { Component } from 'react';


Default vs Named export
=======================
-we can have maximum 1 default export per file , we can have many named exports
-default export member can be imported with any name, but named exports are not
-default exported cann't be used with variables




How javascript executes Synchronous and Async Code
===================================================
heap : is the area where all the variables are stored.

callStack : callstack keeps track of global & function execution

-Regular functions can go to callstack directly for execution
-callback function(promise,setTimeout) cann't go to callstack directly, they have to wait in a queue

-MicroTask Queue : Promise , mutationobserver, queueMicrotask

-MacroTask Queue : setTimeout, setInterval

EventLoop - checks callstack and queue
            decides when async callback functions will go to callstack for execution
