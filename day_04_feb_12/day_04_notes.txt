    Var                         let                       const
=================================================================
5.function/global		 5.block/function/global	5.block/function/global
6.TDZ - No			 	 6.TDZ - Yes				6.TDZ - Yes



Variables Scope
================
1. Global : variables declared outside the functions
2. Function : variables declared inside a function, only visible to that function
3. Block : variables declared inside a block, only visible to that block


Strict Mode
===========
'use strict'
-variables cann't be declared without var/let/const in strict mode
-Duplicate parameter name not allowed



How Javascript Works
====================
-when javascript code is executed, 1 Global Execution Context(anonymous) is added to callstack.
-For each function call, Function Execution Context(f1,f2) is added to callstack.
-Every Execution context has 2 phases
    1. Memory Creation (memory is created for variables,functions & 'undefined' is assigned for 'var' variables)
    2. Code Execution ( code gets executed line by line, variables get their actual value)


Hoisting
========
-'var' variables can be accessed before the actual value initialization, hoisting.
-memory is created for all variables & 'undefined' is assigned for 'var' variables.


Temporal Dead Zone
==================
-During memory Creation, even though memory is created for all variables & 'undefined' is assigned for 'var' variables.
-let & const variables will be present in memory without any value,
    b: <value unavailable>
    c: <value unavailable>
-when we see variables present in memory, but we cannt use them , they are in temporal dead Zone
-we can use let & const variables only after actual value initialization
