Arrow functions
===============
-Shorter Syntax
-implicit return ( return is not required)
-body is optional
-uses 'this' from the lexical/outer scope
-'this' valus is static


'this'
=======
'this' refers to the object that is executing the current function.

Regular Function : this - How/where the function is being called
Arrow Function : this - where the function is written ( lexical / outer )



Arrow function Limitation
==========================
-Arrow functions should not be used as object methods


Closure
=======
A closure is created when:
    -An inner function remembers and access variables from its outer scope, even after outer function has finished execution
-Closure is used 
    a. Data Encapsulation
    b. Factory Function


Notes:
-Closure scope is ctreated only for inner functions and not for outer functions
-All the inner functions will have closure scope? NO
-An inner function will have closure scope only if it is accessing outer function variable
