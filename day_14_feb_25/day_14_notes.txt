CallBack , Promise , Async Await
=================================
-A function is passed as an arguement to another function.
-we want that callback function to execute later when 1 operation is done.

CallBack Hell - writing callback inside callback
    Nested structure, difficult to understand, difficult to maintain

Solutions: Promise , Async-await



Promise:
========
-an object that represents the future value of an asynchronous operation
-A promise says - 'i will give you a result later'
-Promise State : pending , resolved, rejected

how to get data from a promise : 1. then()   2. async-await


Realtime Usecase
================
1. login user
2. fetch user profile
3. fetch cart
4. make payment
5. send confirmation
